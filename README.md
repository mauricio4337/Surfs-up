# Surfs-up

* **Overview**
---
Use SQLAlchemy to connect to data stored in a SQLite file.  The file contains weather data for Honolulu.  The project is to help a Surf and Shaved Ice Shop determine if the shop can expect a significant drop in business during the off season due to weather concerns.  As part of the project, Flask was used to display weather data as API on a local host server.

* **Challenge**
---
The challenge required temperature data to be queried for the months of June and December.  Each data set was saved into a dataframe using Pandas and descriptive statistics were generated for each data set.  Analysis on the data is given below with recommendations for further analysis.
